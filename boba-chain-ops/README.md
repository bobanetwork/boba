# boba-chain-ops

## boba-migrate
This package performs state regenesis. It takes the following input:

1. An `alloaction.json` file that contains a list of pre-allocated accounts.
2. A `genesis.json` file that contains the genesis block configuration.
3. A list of addresses that transacted on the network prior to this past regenesis.
4. A list of addresses that performed approvals on prior versions of the OVM ETH contract.
5. A list of msg information that stores the cross domain message from L2 to L1

It creates an initialized Bedrock erigon database as output. It does this by performing the following steps:

1. Create genesis (types.Genesis) from `genesis.json` and `allocation.json` in memory.
2. Set up the proxy contract for the predeploy contracts and update the bytecode of the predeploy contracts.
3. Migrate Boba legacy proxy implementation contract the new proxy contract and delete the slots
4. Migrate the ETH balance from the storage of OVM ETH contract to the balance field in genesis and delete the ETH balance storage slot.
5. Migrate the msg information from the storage of OVM_CrossDomainMessenger contract to the new slot.

It performs the following integrity checks:

1. OVM ETH storage slots must be completely accounted for.
2. The total supply of OVM ETH migrated must match the total supply of the OVM ETH contract.

### Compilation

Run `make boba-migrate`

## boba-rollover

This package performs state regenesis for creating a legacy chain in erigon. The new chain is only readable and is not compatible with v3. It takes the following input:

1. An `alloaction.json` file that contains a list of pre-allocated accounts.
2. A `genesis.json` file that contains the genesis block configuration.

3. A list of addresses that transacted on the network prior to this past regenesis.

It creates an initialized erigon database as output. It does this by performing the following steps:

1. Migrate the ETH balance from the storage of OVM ETH contract to the balance field in genesis and delete the ETH balance storage slot.

It performs the following integrity checks:

1. OVM ETH storage slots must be completely accounted for.
2. The total supply of OVM ETH migrated must match the total supply of the OVM ETH contract.

### Compilation

Run `make boba-rollover`

## boba-regenerate

This pacakge performs the chain regeneration via calling engine api. It does this by performing the following steps:

1. Call the legacy block chain to get the block and transaction information.
2. Build `PayloadAttributes` and call `engine_forkchoiceUpdatedV1` to get `PayloadID`
3. Call `engine_getPayloadV1` with the `PayloadID` from the last step to get `executionPayload`
4. Call `engine_newPayloadV1` with the `executionPayload` to execute the transaction
5. Call `engine_forkchoiceUpdatedV1` to build the block

It performs the following integrity checks:

1. The block hash and transaction hash must match the legacy block chain

### Compilation

Run `make boba-regenerate`

## boba-crawler

This package performs the process of getting addresses that send or receive ETH from the legacy block chain. It does this by performing the following steps:

1. Call `debug_traceTransaction` to find out addresses that send and receive ETH from internal transactions.
2. Call `eth_getLogs` to find out addresses that receive ETH from the ` ETH Mint` event

It performs the following integrity checks:

1. The address list can be used to compute the all storage keys of `OVM_ETH` contract from the allocation file.

### Compilation

Run `make boba-crawler`

## boba-devnet

This package generates a clean genesis file for devent. It only includes the predeployed contracts for L2. It takes the following input to generate the genesis file:

1. The deployment configuration for the l2
2. The hardhat deployment path
3. The l1 PRC endpoint for quering the block information

### Compilation

Run `make boba-devnet`

## boba-connect

This package generates a transition block between the legacy and new systems. It does this by performing the following steps:

1. A configuration file to get the timestamp of the transition block.
2. Use the engine api to create an empty block with the right block timestamp

### Compilation

Run `make boba-connect`

# Migration

## Preparation

### Files

Before the migration, we need these following files

* `witness.txt` - this includes the set of withdrawals through the `L2CrossDomainMessenger` from after the evm equivalence upgrade. To generate this file, we add the following environment variable in the l2geth client.

  ```yaml
  environment:
    L2GETH_STATE_DUMP_PATH: "/dump/witness.txt"
  volumes:
    - VOLUME_LOCATION:/dump
  ```

* `eth-addresses.json` - this includes all addresses that have transferred or received ETH. When we migrate the slots from the `OVM_ETH` contract to the state, we need this file to compute the storage key of each address. Thes file is generated by `eth-crawler` in `boba-chain-ops` via running 

  ```bash
  go run ./cmd/boba-crawler --rpc-url=https://mainnet.boba.network --output-path=./eth-addresses.json
  ```

* `eth-allowance.json` - this includes all allowances of the `OVM_ETH` contract. For Goerli L2, this file is **EMPTY**. For Mainnet L2, this file is needed and **SHOULDN'T** be empty. Otherwsie, we can't bypass the security checks.

* `ovm-message.json` - this includes the set of withdrawals through the `L2CrossDomainMessenger` from before the evm equivalence upgrade. For Goerli L2, this file is **EMPTY**.

### Contracts

To reduce upgrade time, we can deploy the L1 contracts first, without updating the implementation contracts or setting the L2 start time. We will copy and paste the deployment files from the `boba repo` to the `v3-anchorage` repo. For example, we will copy and paste the [deployment files](https://github.com/bobanetwork/boba/tree/develop/packages/contracts/deployments/mainnet) of Mainnet to [contracts-bedrock](https://github.com/bobanetwork/v3-anchorage/tree/develop/packages/contracts-bedrock/deployments) in the `v3-anchorage` repo. 

> The names of the deployment files for `Proxy__L1StandardBridge` and `Proxy__L1CrossDomainMessenger` must be `Proxy__OVM_L1CrossDomainMessenger.json` and `Proxy__OVM_L1StandardBridge.json`. Therefore, the deployment process can skip these two contracts.

The new network settings should be added to [hardhat.config.ts](https://github.com/bobanetwork/v3-anchorage/blob/develop/packages/contracts-bedrock/hardhat.config.ts) and the configuration file should be added to the [deploy-config](https://github.com/bobanetwork/v3-anchorage/tree/develop/packages/contracts-bedrock/deploy-config) folder. Besides the configuration file, another `.ts` file is required to export the settings. For example,

```ts
import { DeployConfig } from '../scripts/deploy-config'
import config from './boba-local.json'

export default config satisfies DeployConfig
```

To avoid the upgrade, delete the [022-SystemDictatorSteps-1.ts](https://github.com/bobanetwork/v3-anchorage/blob/develop/packages/contracts-bedrock/deploy/022-SystemDictatorSteps-1.ts) and [022-SystemDictatorSteps-2.ts](https://github.com/bobanetwork/v3-anchorage/blob/develop/packages/contracts-bedrock/deploy/023-SystemDictatorSteps-2.ts) and run 

```bash
yarn deploy:hardhat --network boba-mainnet
```

### Erigon

Before generating the database, we need to add the genesis block information to the [v3-erigon-lib](https://github.com/bobanetwork/v3-erigon-lib/blob/boba-bedrock-hardfork/chain/chain_config.go) so that the first block can match the legacy chain. For example,

```go
BobaGoerliChainId = big.NewInt(2888)
BobaGoerliBedrockBlock = big.NewInt(40500)
BobaGoerliGenesisGasLimit = 11000000
BobaGoerliGenesisCoinbase = "0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000000"
BobaGoerliGenesisExtraData = "000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000398232e2064f896018496b4b44b3d62751f0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000"
BobaGoerliGenesisRoot = "0x36c808dc3bb586c14bebde3ca630a4d49a1fdad0b01d7e58f96f2fcd1aa0003d"
```

> The `BobaGoerliBedrockBlock` can be any number that is larger than the final block number of the legacy chain.

A genesis file is needed when we generate the database. An example is

```json
{
  "config": {
    ////////////////////////
    /// EXAMPLE CHAIN ID ///
    ////////////////////////
    "chainId": 911,
    ////////////////////////
    "homesteadBlock": 0,
    "eip150Block": 0,
    "eip150Hash": "0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000",
    "eip155Block": 0,
    "eip158Block": 0,
    "byzantiumBlock": 0,
    "constantinopleBlock": 0,
    "petersburgBlock": 0,
    "istanbulBlock": 0,
    "muirGlacierBlock": 0,
    "berlinBlock": 0,
    "londonBlock": 0,
    "arrowGlacierBlock": 0,
    "grayGlacierBlock": 0,
    "mergeNetsplitBlock": 0,
    "bedrockBlock": 1000,
    "terminalTotalDifficulty": 0,
    "terminalTotalDifficultyPassed": true,
    "optimism": {
      "eip1559Elasticity": 2,
      "eip1559Denominator": 8
    }
  },
  "nonce": "0x0",
  "timestamp": "0x0",
  "extraData": "0x",
  "gasLimit": "0xA7D8C0",
  "difficulty": "0x0",
  "mixHash": "0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000",
  "coinbase": "0x4200000000000000000000000000000000000011",
  "alloc":{},
  "number": "0x0",
  "gasUsed": "0x0",
  "parentHash": "0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000",
  "baseFeePerGas": "0x3b9aca00"
}
```

> The `bedrockBlock` can be any number that is larger than the final block number of the legacy chain. We will overwrite the configuration when we create the transition block.
>
> The `alloc` must be **EMPTY**.

Once we add the genesis block and the genesis file, we can create the db via

``` bash
./build/bin/erigon init --datadir db genesis.json
```

Now we can start the specific erigon built from the [boba-bedrock-hardfork](https://github.com/bobanetwork/v3-erigon/tree/boba-bedrock-hardfork) branch.

```bash
./build/bin/erigon --datadir db --private.api.addr=localhost:9090 --http.addr=0.0.0.0 --http.port=9545 --http.corsdomain="*" --http.vhosts="*" --authrpc.addr=0.0.0.0 --authrpc.port=8551 --authrpc.vhosts="*" --authrpc.jwtsecret=jwt --rollup.disabletxpoolgossip=true --chain=dev --networkid=911 --http.api=eth,debug,net,engine,erigon,web3 --torrent.port=42068 --rollup.historicalrpc=http://localhost:8547 --log.console.verbosity dbug
```

>The `--rollup.historicalrpc` is required to re-generate the legacy chain
>
>*The `--chain` and `--networkid=` should be fixed*

Once we verify that the genesis block is the same as the legacy chain, we can start the [boba-regenerate](https://github.com/bobanetwork/v3-anchorage/blob/develop/boba-chain-ops/cmd/boba-regenerate/main.go) in `boba-chain-ops` using `engine_api` to re-build the legacy block chain in erigon.

```bash
go run ./cmd/boba-regenerate --l2-legacy-endpoint=http://localhost:8547 --jwt-secret-path=jwt
```

## Process

Once we decide the hardfork block for the bedrock, we stop the legacy blockchain and dump the final state from it using the [geth-dump](https://github.com/bobanetwork/v3-anchorage/blob/develop/op-chain-ops/cmd/geth-dump/main.go) in `op-chain-ops`. This creates a final state file for our migration.

```bash
go run ./cmd/geth-dump --db-path=db --output-path=genesis.json
```

> The **hardfork block number** is the **last block number of the legacy chain + 1**.

We now can stop the [boba-regenerate](https://github.com/bobanetwork/v3-anchorage/blob/develop/boba-chain-ops/cmd/boba-regenerate/main.go) and the specific erigon built from the [boba-bedrock-hardfork](https://github.com/bobanetwork/v3-erigon/tree/boba-bedrock-hardfork) branch once it reaches the hardfork block.

---

**!! Important !!**

**An L1 block should be selected at this moment. The block hash and timestamp should be updated in the configuration file for the migration and L1 contract deployment.** For example, the values for  `l1StartingBlockTag` and `l2OutputOracleStartingTimestamp` should be set to the chosen block hash and timestamp respectively in [hardhat-local.json](https://github.com/bobanetwork/v3-anchorage/blob/develop/packages/contracts-bedrock/deploy-config/hardhat-local.json). The `l2OutputOracleStartingBlockNumber`  should be set to the **hardfork block number** in [hardhat-local.json](https://github.com/bobanetwork/v3-anchorage/blob/develop/packages/contracts-bedrock/deploy-config/hardhat-local.json). The `l1BobaTokenAddress`  should be updated to reflect the address where we deployed on L1.

---

Once we update the configuration file, we can continue the L1 contract deployment by running

```
yarn deploy:hardhat --network boba-mainnet
```

The command will finish the rest of configuration settings.

The final step is to insert the transition block and create a `rollup.json` for `op-node`. The genesis block information is needed for [boba-migrate](https://github.com/bobanetwork/v3-anchorage/blob/develop/boba-chain-ops) during the verification process. We can add the following information to the [codebase](https://github.com/bobanetwork/v3-anchorage/blob/develop/boba-chain-ops/chain/chain.go).

```go
BobaGoerliChainId = big.NewInt(2888)
BobaGoerliGenesisGasLimit = 11000000
BobaGoerliGenesisCoinbase = "0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000000"
BobaGoerliGenesisExtraData="000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000398232e2064f896018496b4b44b3d62751f0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000"	BobaGoerliGenesisRoot="0x36c808dc3bb586c14bebde3ca630a4d49a1fdad0b01d7e58f96f2fcd1aa0003d"
BobaGoerliGenesisBlockHash="0xde36bac664c1215f9a7d87cddd3745594b351d3464e8a624e322eddd59ccacf3"
BobaTokenGoerliL1Address = "0xeCCD355862591CBB4bB7E7dD55072070ee3d0fC1"
```

Then we create a genesis file for the migration. For example,

```json
{
  "config": {
    ////////////////////////
    /// EXAMPLE CHAIN ID ///
    ////////////////////////
    "chainId": 911,
     ////////////////////////
    "homesteadBlock": 0,
    "eip150Block": 0,
    "eip150Hash": "0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000",
    "eip155Block": 0,
    "eip158Block": 0,
    "byzantiumBlock": 0,
    "constantinopleBlock": 0,
    "petersburgBlock": 0,
    "istanbulBlock": 0,
    "muirGlacierBlock": 0,
    "berlinBlock": 0,
    "londonBlock": 0,
    "arrowGlacierBlock": 0,
    "grayGlacierBlock": 0,
    "mergeNetsplitBlock": 0,
    /////////////////////////

    "terminalTotalDifficulty": 0,
    "terminalTotalDifficultyPassed": true,
    "optimism": {

      "eip1559Denominator": 8
    }
  },
  "nonce": "0x0",
  "timestamp": "0x0",
  "extraData": "0x",
  /////////////////////////

  "gasLimit": "0x1C9C380",

  "difficulty": "0x0",
  "mixHash": "0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000",
  "coinbase": "0x4200000000000000000000000000000000000011",
  "alloc":{},
  "number": "0x0",
  "gasUsed": "0x0",
  "parentHash": "0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000",
  "baseFeePerGas": "0x3b9aca00"
}
```

>The `bedrockBlock` must be the same as  `l2OutputOracleStartingBlockNumber`  which is **hardfork block number**

Once we prepare everything, we can run the [boba-mirgate](https://github.com/bobanetwork/v3-anchorage/blob/develop/boba-chain-ops/cmd/boba-migrate/main.go) to insert the transition block.

```bash
go run ./cmd/boba-migrate 
--l1-rpc-url=l1-node \
--db-path=erigon-db \
--alloc-path=geth-allocation.json \
--genesis-config-path=genesis.json \
--ovm-addresses=eth-addresses.json \
--ovm-allowances=eth-allowance.json \
--ovm-messages=ovm-message.json \
--witness-file=witness.txt \
--deploy-config=boba-local.json \
--network=boba-local \
--hardhat-deployments=deployment-folder \
--outfile-rollup=rollup.json \
```

If all checks pass during the above process, we are ready to lanuch the bedrock!

## DevOps

Since we will run the op-node and erigon in **an EC instance**, is it possible to do the all following operations in this **EC2 instance**? 

### Replica

We will run a replica node and add this new configuration to generate the `witness.txt`.

```yaml
environment:
  L2GETH_STATE_DUMP_PATH: "/dump/witness.txt"
volumes:
  - VOLUME_LOCATION:/dump
```

### Erigon

We will run an erigon node and re-generate the legacy block chain. Once we reach the hardfork block, we will do the migration and insert the transition block to this db. This db will be used to start the bedrock and distributed to all partners. 

### boba-crawler

We will run a `boba-crawler` program to get all ETH addresses pointing at the **replica node**.

### boba-regenerate

We will run a `boba-regenerate` program to re-generate the legacy block chain pointing at the **erigon node**.

### Note

We will distribute the erigon db to our partners. What's the best way to handle this case?

## Abort migration

We can restore the legacy system by resetting the addresses in `Lib_AddressManager` and restoring the implementation contracts of the proxy contracts.

* Register following contracts

  ```json
  {
    "OVM_CanonicalTransactionChain",
    "OVM_L2CrossDomainMessenger",
    "OVM_DecompressionPrecompileAddress",
    "OVM_Sequencer",
    "OVM_Proposer",
    "OVM_ChainStorageContainer-CTC-batches",
    "OVM_ChainStorageContainer-CTC-queue",
    "OVM_CanonicalTransactionChain",
    "OVM_StateCommitmentChain",
    "OVM_BondManager",
    "OVM_ExecutionManager",
    "OVM_FraudVerifier",
    "OVM_StateManagerFactory",
    "OVM_StateTransitionerFactory",
    "OVM_SafetyChecker",
    "OVM_L1MultiMessageRelayer",
    "BondManager"
  }
  ```

* Update the following implementation contracts

  ```json
  {
  	"Proxy__L1CrossDomainMessenger",
  	"Proxy__L1StandardBridge"
  }
  ```

# Hybrid Compute

We will move the `BobaTuringCredit` contract from address `0x4200000000000000000000000000000000000020` to `0x42000000000000000000000000000000000003e8`. The new `BobaHCHelper` contract will be pre-deployed at `0x42000000000000000000000000000000000003E9`. The legacy storage of `BobaTuringHelper` at `0x4200000000000000000000000000000000000021` will be destroyed and replaced by the standard proxy contract.

To maintain consistency in storage between the old and new `BobaTuringCredit` contracts, we will migrate the storage from the old contract to the new one.
